## Title
Automatization of matching Ifc data with environmental data
## Brief summary
Our script can extract materials within an IfcMaterialLayer and match it with environmental data, by creating a Bag Of Word matrix, to run a cosine similarity check. In the end five materials will be suggested to the specific IfcMaterialLayer.
