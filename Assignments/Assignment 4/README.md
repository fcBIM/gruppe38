# Automatization of matching Ifc data with environmental data
- Group 38 - consisting of Frede Søndergaard Møllegaard s203729 and Kasper Holst s233432
- This tool is targeting the role level 2 - Analyst. 

We have been working with the focus area materials / LCA / Materials / Sustainability Assessmentdeveloping. With this focus area we have focused on creating a script that can extract materials within a IfcMaterialLayer and match it by by creating a Bag Of Word matrix vector query to run a cosine similarity check which in the end will give the user 5 suggestions to match the specific material with material from the environmental data. This can potentially lead to an automatization on creating LCI list for the LCA.
