# Assignment 5 reflect on the course


## Group

Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended :

What else do you still need to learn?

how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

Your process of developing the tutorial
Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?



(As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial
did the tool address the use case you identified?

(Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM - 

#### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
I'm quite open towards it - I'm curently on the first semester of my masters, so got a little time before that. However I'm quite interested in the field of sustainability and digitalization, which could mean that I would be likely to use different BIM tools, that have been introduced throughout this course. 


#### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
I hope that it is going to be a something I'll use or touch upon something I use. Worst nightmare is "manual labour" in the excel sheets and i definetly see OpenBIM as a way to avoid some of that:)) Already been trying to use it a little bit on small task as a student worker, but it's still limited. 

#### Conclude the journey through A1-A5
I've enjoyed the different parts of the journey.
the guest lectures were also very inspirering and gave a nice picture of what else moved in the world of BIM. Maybe a day in the middle of it to get focus back on the assignment would have been great. I liked how we both got to work on the strategic level with bpmn, and then got time in depth to create a script/tool.
