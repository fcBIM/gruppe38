# Assignment 5 - Project and course reflection

### Our learning experience for the concept you focused on.

### Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended :

We defined ourselves as 1 - Disagree to the quesiton: "I am confident coding in Python"

### What else do you still need to learn?

### how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

### Your process of developing the tutorial
We did find it quite difficult to find the time to create a tutorial on how the tool was working, 

### Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

### Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

### Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?



### Summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial

We got some really useful feedback from the other groups. First of all, we chose to do a presentation in plenum in our Focus Area group, which gave us the perfect opportunity to get a lot of different feedback. Another positive was that some people was more proficient in the programming skill, some with a lot of sustainability knowledge, some with good communication skills, and this provided us with a lot of good feedback. 

Some of the feedback we got was to state the use case even more clear and what the tool was actually capable of doing. It's true that being the developers of the tool has made us maybe think it's a simple tool to understand, but in reality it is quite a complex concept and by explaining the scripts code more in detail could deliver a better understanding on what the tool is able to do.

Other useful feedback we got was that we should try to implement a bigger material library, such as the BR18 attachment 2, tabel 7. in order to broaden our matching capabilities and potentially also make it more applicable to the analyst in the real world.

Lastly, we got feedback on the tool and that we should maybe try to implement some more user-friendliness besides the JSON and excel files. But overall they thought that our ideas was creative and that we did a good presentation.


## Individual

### Frede

#### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
I'm quite open towards it - I'm curently on the first semester of my masters, so got a little time before that. However I'm quite interested in the field of sustainability and digitalization, which could mean that I would be likely to use different BIM tools, that have been introduced throughout this course, which have been very inspiring.


#### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
I hope that it is going to be a something I'll use or touch upon something I use. Worst nightmare is "manual labour" in the excel sheets and i definetly see OpenBIM as a way to avoid some of that:)) Already been trying to use it a little bit on small task as a student worker, but it's still limited, due to lack of time and a very defined workflows+tools. 

#### Conclude the journey through A1-A5
I've enjoyed the different parts of the journey.
the guest lectures were also very inspirering and gave a nice picture of what else moved in the world of BIM. Maybe a day in the middle of it to get focus back on the assignment would have been great. I liked how we both got to work on the strategic level with bpmn, and then got time to create a script/tool in depth.

### Kasper

#### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
I have enjoyed expanding my BIM knowledge, from the knowledge I got in "Introduction to OpenBIM" during my 2nd semester, and I definitely regret not taking this course on my 1st semester last year instead of now. This Course could have opened way more doors for my experience during "Advanced Building Design" course on my 2nd semester. Albeit, I feel like this course did open some doors into the digitization in the building industry but, in order for me to feel more comfortable to take my knowledge and use it in my thesis, I would prefer more time for trial and error and perhaps another course where I could implement my experiences. I don't exclude the fact that I could use it in my thesis but right now I would rather prefer some more LCA heavy thesis.

#### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
I definitely see myself using the tools we have learned in this course in the future, whether it be on a more theoretical or practical basis I don't dare to say, but I know I would need to improve my programming skills in order to be efficient with some of the themes from this course. I see a great potential in the ability to extract the data from models, and implement new ideas by the help of programming and scripting relevant tools.

#### Conclude the journey through A1-A5

In the beginning during assignment 1, it was quite a confusing process, what group am I in?, What is the assignment? and what is this going to end with? These were some questions popping up in my head, but slowly during Assignment 2 and 3 it became more clear to me what the real task was going to be. Especially during Assignment 3 the time to learn how to program and what these skills was useful for became clear, although the process of developing our tool wasn't frictionless. It became quite clear that trying to explain a complex programming concept to another person, was difficult, and we slowly began to implement small "use case diagrams" and "flow charts" when developing the tool. This process gave me a better understanding on how to discuss abd create a tool in a collaboration.
