# Assignment 5 reflect on the course


## Group

Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended :

What else do you still need to learn?

how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

Your process of developing the tutorial
Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?



(As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial
did the tool address the use case you identified?
