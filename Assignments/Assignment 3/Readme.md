# Assignment 3 Tool:

## 01 The IFC model
The IFC model used for developing this script is from the course Advanced Building Design course group #2406.
We are using this IFC file 

## 02 Explanation on this markdown file:
This is based on the Use Case Analysis we did in A2. In this section we will discuss the changes that the tool has undergone since last assignment.

- Less ambition  
- More user friendly
- Single and simple entity such as internal wall (if there are multiple layers in a single material layer, then we can't match the correct data to the layer).
### About the tool

Values from PM appendix #2406 is used to double check whether the results of our tool are close to the LCA that the group have done.
In principle the imported environmental data will change values depending on the EPD's included. 
State the problem / claim that your tool is solving.

State where you found that problem.

Description of the tool

instructions to run the tool.

### Advanced Building Design
What Advanced Building Design Stage (A,B,C or D) would your tool be usefuL?
A-D
- Early design stage 
- Simplifying end result of LCA of building.
  
Which subjects might use it?
ARC, STR, PM, 

Potential roles in the future could be sustainability analysts for the ABD course, 

What information is required in the model for your tool to work?

Look at assignment 2 - furter included with new tool.

### Further development for this tool:

Ability to implement a "decision tree" if it's a wall = m2 if it's a 

## 03 An IDS:
Produce an IDS to check that the model can be run by your tool.
